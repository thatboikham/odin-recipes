<h4>Description</h4>
<p>​This potato salad is dedicated to everyone who somehow,someway manages to burn something while barbecuing. Whether it’s turning a perfectly cooked rack of ribs jet black while trying to “caramelize” the BBQ sauce, or starting the burger buns on fire because you heard Chef John say they’re better lightly toasted, if there are hot coals around, these poor souls will find a way to incinerate something. Well, this time we’re doing it on purpose. </p>
<p>Potatoes are loaded with nutrients including fiber, vitamin C and potassium – they're also free of fat and cholesterol. No matter which recipe you choose, potatoes are often accompanied by good-for-you veggies and herbs like celery, onions, carrots, parsley, dill and basil.</p>
